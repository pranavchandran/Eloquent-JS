4.It can be useful for a function to accept any number of arguments. For example, Math.max 
computes the maximum of all the arguments it is given.
To write such a function, you put three dots before the function’s last parameter, like this:

5.console.log(horseShoe.charCodeAt(1));

let ages = new Map();
ages.set('Boris', 39);
ages.set('Pranav', 32);
ages.set('Julia', 62);

console.log(`Pranav is ${ages.get("Pranav")}`);
console.log("Is Jack's age known?", ages.has("Julia"));

8. About call()

    firstName:"John",
    lastName: "Doe"
    }
    var person2 = {
    firstName:"Mary",
    lastName: "Doe"
    }

/Second example
    var person = {
    fullName: function(city, country) {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + "," + city + "," + country;
    }
